**Progress in the moment of the first push:**

not all. Documentation will be written at the
refactoring stage. Sorry.
- Physics: Rigidbody in the progress. Does not
work in this moment.
- SmartText: Is the smart system, that can
colorize the text by tags like: `[#fffff]`,
`[bg#ff0000]`, `[red]`, `[reset]`, etc.

*colliders based on the* [collision2d](https://github.com/Tarliton/collision2d)
*library.*

- - `Tilemap` - *Easily places a tiles with the*
*own coordinate system*
- - `Transform` - *Base of almost any game object*
- - **UI**:

*mouse clicks or hovering*
- - - `UISprite` - *Simplified version of the*
*Sprite. Used only for drawing sprites on the*
